Feel the floor beneath you; it will be smooth and likely cool to the touch due to its tiled nature.\n\n2. **Texture Change**: As you continue moving forward, you may notice a change in texture under your feet from the hard tile to a softer, likely carpeted area. This indicates you are approaching the living space.\n\n3. **Open Space**: You will encounter an open space where the density of objects in the room becomes less clustered. This is the main living area.\n\n4. **Edge Detection**: Using your feet or a cane, detect the edges of objects in your path. You will need to navigate around the edge of a coffee table which should be in line with your hip or waist height.\n\n5. **Orientation**: Keep the table to your right side as you pass it. This will orient you towards the sofa.\n\n6. **Distance**: After bypassing the table, take about two to three steps forward. The exact number of steps can vary depending on your stride length.\n\n7. **Sofa Detection**: Extend your hand out to feel for the sofa. It should be directly in front of you after the steps mentioned above. The sofa will feel soft and cushioned, and you will likely feel the armrest at one end.\n\n8. **Confirmation**: Once you have detected the sofa, run your hand along the back and seat cushions to confirm its shape and size, ensuring it is the three-seat sofa you are targeting.\n\nIf you have someone with you, they can tap the sofa as you approach it, providing an auditory cue for its location.
